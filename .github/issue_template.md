If you have a question that doesn't concern bugs or requests, all i am asking you is to look for answers first before you hit submit. When you haven't found anything, please isolate your issue in a [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), that makes it so much easier on our side to inspect and understand the issue. Also think about posting [in our community](https://spectrum.chat/react-spring) to keep the issue tracker focussed on bugs and features.

Thanks for understanding!
