## Why the focus on spring physics instead of durations?

Cheng Lou explains it best ...

In short, durations and easings are the number one reason UI animation is hard (and usually looks bad). This is why our focus is on physics first and foremost, where duration mathematically doesn't exist since springs are adaptive, or in other words, they work with energetic load and momentum instead of hardcoded values.

Think of it like this, if you cause an animation and abort somewhere near the middle, a spring will fluidly move back according to the energy it spent getting there as if you would actually pull back a physical spring mid-momentum, whereas in a duration-based animation it would stop abruptly and naively move back taking the hard-coded time it would have spent getting to end-state using the same curve.

It can be odd in the beginning thinking of animation not in terms of time, but once you let go things will start to make sense and creating fluid interfaces will be easier than ever.

### "But, ... i **want** to use durations" ðŸ˜¤

You still can.

```jsx
import * as easings from 'd3-ease'

<Spring ... config={{ duration: 3000, easing: easings.easeCubic }}>
```

## Animating "auto"

react-spring is one of the few libs that understands and animates auto, so you can use it in your configs, like so:

```jsx
<Spring from={{ height: 0 }} to={{ height: 'auto' }}>
```

Keep in mind that in order to do this we have to measure out a snapshot set to height/width: auto before we can start animating it. There are some things you should watch out for:

1. Wrong width/height. If you notice that the measured bounds are wrong, give your view more context, for instance set the position attribute of the parent container (the element that contains your spring) to either absolute or relative so that the view (the element that's inside your spring) retains bounds.

2. Contents change but won't animate. If you set your spring to auto and later add or remove contents (children), it doesn't animate since it's essentially going from "auto" to "auto". In these rare cases you can use the `force` prop, which forces the spring to animate regardless of whether props are the same or not.

```jsx
<Spring force from={{ height: 0 }} to={{ height: 'auto' }}>
  {items.map(id => <Item key={id} />)}
```

3. Nested auto-springs eat into their animations. If you nest springs and click one open and close another, the measurements will conflict for a moment. There is no real solution here. Something you can do to help it is make sure springs animate with less precision so that they will complete faster.

```jsx
<Spring
  from={{ height: 0 }} to={{ height: 'auto' }} config={{ ...config.default, precision: 1 }}>
```

## Manual API

The `Controller` is react-springs heart, all primitives use it internally (including hooks). If you dislike render-props, and maybe hooks are too radical for you, then perhaps this is what you are looking for as it gives you full manual control without having to worry about loose-end animation handles. The api is very similar to the useSpring hook.

```jsx
import { Controller, animated } from 'react-spring'

class Test extends React.Component {
  state = { show: true }
  animations = new Controller({ opacity: 0 })
  toggle = () => this.setState(state => ({ show: !show }))
  render() {
    const props = this.animations.update({ opacity: this.state.show ? 1 : 0 })
    return (
      <>
        <button onClick={this.toggle}>click</button>
        <animated.div style={props}>I will fade</animated.div>
      </>
    )
  }
}
```

## Browser Support
react-spring requires the following polyfills below for Internet Explorer.
```javascript
String.prototype.startsWith
Object.entries
Array.prototype.includes
Array.prototype.findIndex
Set
```
