# Hooks, manual api

<p>
  <span className="highlight">
    React-spring offers multiple ways to animate
  </span>
  , the one which you'll probably use most is the declarative and render-prop driven
  way which is front and center. But there is a second, imperative way which you
  can either use raw or with the help of Reacts new "hooks" feature which establishes
  a class-less component architecture (currently in alpha, and you'll need both react@next
  and react-dom@next to use it).
</p>

## Hooks

The React team has recently [unveiled hooks](https://conf.reactjs.org/). This feature allows you to create fully capable functional components that can store permanent data and cause effects. All react-spring primitives are now available as hooks.

```jsx
import {
  useSpring,
  useTransition,
  useTrail,
  useKeyframes,
  animated,
} from 'react-spring/hooks'
```

You can use this hook to define and update data. The data you pass in consists of the same props you would normally give a spring, with the distinction that unknown values are interpolated to `to` by default, similar to how [Keyframes](/keyframes) roll. You can drop in everything, it understands numbers, percentages, strings, colors and so on. See [/spring#interpolation](/spring#interpolation).

```jsx
function App() {
  const [props] = useSpring({
    opacity: 1,
    color: 'blue',
    from: { opacity: 0, color: 'rgba(21,45,60,0.1)' },
  })
  return (
    <animated.div style={props}>i will fade in and shift my color</animated.div>
  )
}
```

## Demos

<DemoGrid padding={0}>
  {examples.map(data => (
    <Demo
      key={data.name}
      {...data}
      link={`https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring/tree/master/examples/demos/${
        data.name
      }`}
      import={import('../examples/demos/' + data.name)}
    />
  ))}
</DemoGrid>
