# Hooks

The React team has recently [unveiled hooks](https://conf.reactjs.org/). This feature allows you to create fully capable functional components that can store permanent data and cause effects. All react-spring primitives are now available as hooks. Hooks are still in alpha, you'll need both react@next and react-dom@next to use it.

```jsx
import {
  useSpring,
  useTransition,
  useTrail,
  useKeyframes,
  animated,
} from 'react-spring/hooks'
```

## useSpring

The `useSpring` hook does the same thing a regular `<Spring />` component would do. You give it data and it returns animated-props, which you can then distribute among your views. You can update data either by overwriting it, or by calling `set` which updates the spring without causing a render pass (which is great for iteractive input, mouse events, etc).

```jsx
const [props, set] = useSpring({ opacity: 1, from: { opacity: 0 } })
return <animated.div style={props}>i will fade in</animated.div>
```

## useTrail

The `useTrail` hook replaces `<Trail />`. The api is the same as `useSpring`, with the distinction that you pass items, just like you would with a regular `<Trail />` component. You get a collection back, which contains your items and animated props. You can update it by overwriting it or by calling the `set` function.

```jsx
const [items] = useState(['A', 'B', 'C'])
const [trail, set] = useTrail({ items, opacity: 1, from: { opacity: 0 } })
return trail.map(({ item, props }) => (
  <animated.div key={item} style={props}>
    {item}
  </animated.div>
))
```

## useTransition

The `useTransition` hook replaces `<Transition />`. You give it data and it returns animated-props, which you can then distribute among your views. You can update data either by overwriting it, or by calling `set` which updates the spring without causing a render pass (which is great for iteractive input, mouse events, etc).

```jsx
const [items] = useState(['A', 'B', 'C'])
const transitions = useTransition({
  items,
  from: { opacity: 0 },
  enter: { opacity: 1 },
  leave: { opacity: 0 },
})
return transitions.map(({ item, key, props }) => (
  <animated.div key={key} style={props}>
    {item}
  </animated.div>
))
```

## useKeyframes

The `useKeyframes` replaces the `Keyframes` factory. It has almost the same API. You give it named slots (or a function, or an array). You toggle these slots by passing the name of the slot you want to run as the second argument. If you do not use slots (when you either declare a function or an array as the first argument) you don't need the second argument.

You can use also trail keyframes by using `useKeyframes.trail`

```jsx
const useSlot = useKeyframes.spring({
  // Single props
  show: { opacity: 1 },
  // Chained animations (arrays)
  showAndHide: [{ opacity: 1 }, { opacity: 0 }],
  // Functions with side-effects with access to component props
  wiggle: async (next, cancel, ownProps) => {
    await next({ x: 100 })
    await delay(1000)
    await next({ x: 0 })
  },
})

function App() {
  const [state, set] = useState('show')
  const props = useSlot(state)
  return <animated.div style={props}>content</animated.div>
}
```

# Demos

<DemoGrid padding={0}>
  {examples.map(data => (
    <Demo
      key={data.name}
      {...data}
      import={import('../examples/demos/' + data.name)}
    />
  ))}
</DemoGrid>
