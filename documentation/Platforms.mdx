# Other platforms

React-spring is a cross-platform library by default, you could take it and animate on all react-platforms. 

```jsx
// The default export is valid for react-native as well
import { Spring } from 'react-spring'

// react-konva
import { Spring } from 'react-spring/konva'

// Any other target or platform
import { Spring } from 'react-spring/universal'
```

The default export points to react-dom when running in web and to react-native when running in react-native. If you want to animate any other target refer to /universal. Each target defines platform specific constants (colors, units, etc.). The universal target is the least specific.

In react-native you can still use the native keyword for more performance, create your own animated-components by calling into the animated function.

```jsx
import { View } from 'react-native'

const AnimatedView = animated(View)

<Spring native from={{ opacity: 0 }} to={{ opacity: 1 }}>
  {styles => <AnimatedView style={styles} />}
</Spring>
```
