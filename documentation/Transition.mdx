# Transition

```jsx
import { Transition } from 'react-spring'

<Transition
  keys={items.map(item => item.key)}
  from={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}
  enter={{ opacity: 1, height: 30 }}
  leave={{ opacity: 0, height: 0 }}>
  {items.map(item => styles => <li style={styles}>{item.text}</li>)}
</Transition>
```

## Basics

A `Transition` watches elements as they mount and unmount or otherwise change, it helps you to animate these changes. It also preserves leaving elements in their very last state, so you can safely animate them out before they vanish. For this reason you should always think of `Transition` as a stack, it is never just one element. Consider this when you need elements to fade in and out on top of one another, which calls for `position: absolute`, unless you want a stack or a list where elements push away other elements.

The following immitates a list that is dropping and gaining items.

<Playground style={{ overflow: 'hidden', height: 100 }}>
  <List initial={['Apples', 'Oranges', 'Bananas']}>
    {({ list, push, pull }) => (

      // I'd like to call setTimeouts on startup, removing an item on the first,
      // adding items on the second, can't do it here coz it would cause a loop

      <Transition
        keys={list}
        from={{ overflow: 'hidden', height: 0 }}
        enter={{ height: 30, background: '#28d79f' }}
        leave={{ height: 0, background: '#c23369' }}
        update={{ background: '#28b4d7' }}
        config={config.molasses}>
        {list.map(item => props => <div style={props}>{item}</div>)}
      </Transition>
    )}
  </List>
</Playground>

## Props

Other than the props listed here `Transition` can take all the props that `Spring` accepts (config, native, immediate, onRest, etc).

<PropsTable of={Transition} />

## 2-state and 1-state Reveals

Given a single child instead of a list you can toggle between two components. If you want these two on top of one another make sure to position them absolutely.

```jsx
<Transition
  from={{ position: 'absolute', opacity: 0 }}
  enter={{ opacity: 1 }}
  leave={{ opacity: 0 }}>
  {toggle
    ? styles => <div style={styles}>Component A</div>
    : styles => <div style={styles}>Component B</div>
  }
</Transition>
```

If you need to toggle a single child, that is also possible.

```jsx
<Transition
  from={{ position: 'absolute', opacity: 0 }}
  enter={{ opacity: 1 }} 
  leave={{ opacity: 0 }}>
  {visible && (styles => <div style={styles}>Single Component</div>)}
</Transition>
```

## Individual Transitions

For more complex transitions you can return per-item values individually. Let `Transition` know the actual data by passing it raw to `items`, either pass your keys like always or give it an accessor. This allows you to set values individually since all value props accept functions. And for more control, there's `update` which fires for nodes that are neither entering nor leaving, use it to update present items.

```jsx
<Transition
  items={items}
  keys={item => item.key}
  from={item => ({ opacity: 0 })}
  enter={item => ({ opacity: 1 })}
  update={item => ({ opacity: 0.5 })}
  leave={item => ({ opacity: 0 })}>
  {items.map(item => styles => <li style={styles}>{item.text}</li>)}
</Transition>
```
