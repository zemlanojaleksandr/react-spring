# Keyframes

```jsx
import { Keyframes } from 'react-spring'
```

## Basics

`Keyframes` allow you to chain, compose and orchestrate animations by creating predefined slots which you then execute by passing the state prop.

The resulting primitive can receive all the generic properties you would normally give your springs, like native, from, and so on.

```jsx
// You can create keyframes for springs, trails and transitions
const Container = Keyframes.Spring({
  // Single props
  show: { to: { opacity: 1 } },
  // Chained animations (arrays)
  showAndHide: [ { to: { opacity: 1 } }, { to: { opacity: 0 } }],
  // Functions with side-effects with access to component props
  wiggle: async (next, ownProps) => {
    await next({ to: { x: 100 }, config: config.wobbly })
    await delay(1000)
    await next({ to: { x: 0 }, config: config.gentle })
  }
})

<Container state="show">
  {styles => <div style={styles}>Hello</div>}
</Container>
```

There is a shortcut for low-level scripting by giving it a function instead of an object consisting of slots (good for loops and such). In this case the state prop can be omitted.

```jsx
// Will fade children in and out in a loop
const Container = Keyframes.Spring(async next => {
  while (true) {
    await next({
      reset: true,
      from: { opacity: 0 },
      to: { opacity: 1 },
    })
  }
})

<Container>
  {styles => <div style={styles}>Hello</div>}
</Container>
```

And another for arrays:

```jsx
const Container = Keyframes.Spring([
  { to: { scale: 1.5 } },
  { to: { scale: 1 } },
])
```

`Spring` and `Trail` also have a .to shortcut to make it even leaner. It will try to interpolate animatable props, but you can still use regular Spring-props like delay, immediate and so on, just be aware that they are reserved.

```jsx
const Container = Keyframes.Spring.to([
  { immediate: true, delay: 500, scale: 1.5 },
  { scale: 1 },
])
```

If you have made your own animation primitive and want to drive it through keyframes, that is also doable:

```jsx
const Container = Keyframes.create(MyOwnPrimitive)({ ... })
```

## Props

Other than the props listed here `Keyframes` can take all the props that `Spring` accepts (config, native, immediate, onRest, etc).
