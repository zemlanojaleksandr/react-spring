# Build targets

```jsx
// React-native
import { Spring, animated, ... } from 'react-spring/dist/native'

// Any other target or platform
import { Spring, animated, ... } from 'react-spring/dist/universal'
```

The default export points to react-dom. If you want to animate react-native refer to /dist/native, and /dist/universal for any other target. Each target defines platform specific constants (colors, units, etc.). The universal target is the least specific.

In react-native you can still use the native keyword for more performance, create your own animated-components by calling into the animated function.

```jsx
import { View } from 'react-native'

const AnimatedView = animated(View)

<Spring native from={{ opacity: 0 }} to={{ opacity: 1 }}>
  {styles => <AnimatedView style={styles} />}
</Spring>
```
