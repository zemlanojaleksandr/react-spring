# Addons

```jsx
import {
  TimingAnimation,
  OscillatorAnimation,
  Easing,
  Fade,
  Slug,
  DurationTrail,
} from 'react-spring/dist/addons'
```

You'll find varying implementations under [/dist/addons](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring/tree/master/src/addons). For now there's a time-based animation as well common [easings](https://github.com/drcmda/react-spring/blob/master/src/addons/Easing.js), and IOS'es harmonic oscillator spring. All primitives understand the `impl` property which you can use to switch implementations.
