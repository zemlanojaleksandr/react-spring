# useSpring

```js
import { useSpring, animated } from 'react-spring'
```

Turns values into animated-values.

### Either: overwrite values to change the animation

If you re-render the component with changed props, the animation will update.

```jsx
const props = useSpring({ opacity: toggle ? 1 : 0 })
```

### Or: pass a function that returns values, and update using "set"

You will get a `set` function back. It will not cause the component to render like an overwrite would (still the animation executes of course). Handling updates like this is useful for fast-occurring updates, but you should generally prefer it.

```jsx
const [props, set] = useSpring(() => ({ opacity: 1 }))
// ...
set({ opacity: toggle ? 1 : 0 })
```

### Finally: distribute animated props among the view

The return value is an object containing animated props. 

```jsx
return <animated.div style={props}>i will fade</animated.div>
```

## Properties

All properties of the [shared-api](/api) apply.

## Additional notes

### To-prop shortcut

Any property that useSpring does not recognize will be combined into "to", for instance `opacity: 1` will become `to: { opacity: 1 }`.

```jsx
// This ...
const props = useSpring({ opacity: 1, color: 'red' })
// is a shortcut for this ...
const props = useSpring({ to: { opacity: 1, color: 'red' } })
```

### Async chains/scripts

The to-property also allows you to either script your animation, or chain multiple animations together. Since these animations will execute asynchroneously make sure to provide a "from" property for base values, otherwise props will be empty.

#### This is how you create a script

```jsx
const props = useSpring({ 
  to: async (next, cancel) => {
    await next({ opacity: 1, color: '#ffaaee' })
    await next({ opacity: 0, color: 'rgb(14,26,19)' })
  },
  from: { opacity: 0, color: 'red' } 
})
// ...
return <animated.div style={props}>I will fade in and out</animated.div>
```

#### And this is how you create a chain

```jsx
const props = useSpring({ 
  to: [{ opacity: 1, color: '#ffaaee' }, { opacity: 0, color: 'rgb(14,26,19)' }],
  from: { opacity: 0, color: 'red' } 
})
// ...
return <animated.div style={props}>I will fade in and out</animated.div>
```


## Demos

<DemoGrid padding={0}>
  {examples.filter(data => data.tags.includes('useSpring')).map(data => (
    <Demo
      key={data.name}
      {...data}
      import={import('../examples/demos/' + data.name)}
    />
  ))}
</DemoGrid>
